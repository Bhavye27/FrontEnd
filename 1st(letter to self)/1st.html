      <p>
         It's been a long time since I am  doing front-end designing and I am indulged in it in every possible manner,To see the output of the hardwork and efforts that I put in my codes is the best feeling ever.My work is a clear image of my own personality and persona.
      </p>
      <p>
          Somehow,somewhere in between of my work I hit a bump,a problem that seem to have cornered me .After hitting the rock bottom all I do is take a back seat on my work and take a <b>ME</b> time.Listen to my favourote music tracks,drink a hot cup of coffee and just relax my mind to have a clear vision .Consulting friends is the best thing to do as we get a proper insight of our problem from another persons perspectve,and that somehow cuts the stress.     
	      <br><br>
		  What i have is a dream,a goal that i wish to achieve no matter whatever the cost is.All I want is to reach the pinacle of success and to make everyone who ever trused me proud.
