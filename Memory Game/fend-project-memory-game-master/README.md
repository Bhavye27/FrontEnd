# Memory Game Project

* Open the Project using the `.zip` file provided. 

## Getting started

* The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of Memory Game is to flip and match all the turned-down cards in as few moves as possible. I built a complete browser-based card matching game.

## Tools required:

* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaScript 
* Bootstrap 
* JQuery 
* Materialize

## References:

* [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## The Cards

Right now, Memory game's size is a 4 x 4 grid, meaning 16 cards. 

## Steps to run the Game:

* Open the project through the `.zip` file provided and extract file.
* Open `Index.html`.

## How To Play

* Click on any 2 cards.
* If they match, they stay flipped otherwise they become unflipped.
* Match all the cards with each other.

## Project Building Instructions

* Display 8 cards.
* Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets of 8.
* Randomize the display of cards.
* Add selected style for selected cards.
* Only allow two cards to be selected at a time.
* Determine if two selected cards are a match.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* Add delay to selections.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
* When all cards match, you win.
* Finished game!
